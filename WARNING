WARNING 

This commit -- as of January 15, 2008 -- will require a rebuild of your database tables due to several changes to the DDL.

It will also invalidate any content packages you may have uploaded previously (either into the Sakai content repository or into your
local webapp directory). 

To clear out all the SCORM tables, run scorm-impl/sql/drop_tables.sql
