   NOTES:<br />
   The <i>[NO ACTIVITY TO DELIVER]</i> page indicates that the ADL Sequencer traversed 
   the conceptual activity tree to a point where there is no activity to deliver. 
   This is not necessarily an error. For instance, the sequencing process may not 
   deliver any content, but may indicate to the LMS RTE service that a menu is to 
   be displayed. A menu (choice) selection, in this case, would case a navigation 
   event that would display associated content.
   <br /><br />
   Typical reasons this page is being encountered include:
   <ul>
      <li>The Current Activity has terminated without indicating the next Navigation 
         Request to be processed.</li>
      <li>A Navigation Request has been invoked that does not result in identifying 
         an activity for delivery and no other exception has been identified.</li>
      <li>The attempt to terminate the Current Activity resulted in an exception.  
         This error will only occur if the sequencer has entered an unstable state 
         caused by the Sample RTE closing unexpectedly.</li>
   </ul>
