   NOTES:<br />
   The <i>[INVALIDEVENT]</i> page indicates that the ADL Sequencer received a 
   navigation event that is not permissible. Look at the User Interface controls 
   present during course execution and evaluate whether they should be visible.
   <br /><br />
   Typical reasons this page is being encountered include:
   <ul>
      <li>A Continue Navigation Request has been invoked within a flow = False 
         cluster.</li>
      <li>A Previous Navigation Request has been invoked from the root of the 
         Activity Tree.</li>
      <li>A Previous Navigation Request has been invoked within a forward-only 
         cluster.</li>
      <li>A Choice Navigation Request has targeted an activity within a choice 
         = False cluster.</li>
      <li>A Choice Navigation Request has targeted an activity that is hidden 
         from choice.</li>
   </ul>
