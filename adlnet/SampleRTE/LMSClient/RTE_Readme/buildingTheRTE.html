	            	NOTE: It is not a requirement to build the Sample RTE 
                    before using it.  It will install as a fully operational 
                    unit.  It is only necessary to build the Sample RTE if the 
                    source code has been changed.

		         <em>In order to compile the Sample RTE, the full installation
		         instructions must be completed first.</em>  The Sample RTE 
		         build file depends on a full jakarta-tomcat-5.0.16 install, 
		         along with resources provided in the installation of the RTE.  
                 It is important to note that when the RTE is built, it 
                 overwrites the previously installed Sample RTE. To move back 
                 to the original RTE, the un-install must be executed and then 
                 the downloaded self-extracting executable must be re-run.
	         </p>
	         <p>
		         The Sample RTE is built using Apache Ant, a Java-based build tool.
		         <b>Before building the Sample RTE, Ant must be installed.</b>
		         For information about and downloads of Ant, see
	         	<a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">http://ant.apache.org/</a>.
	         </p>
	
	         <em>
	         	To build the Sample RTE:
	         </em>
	         <ul>
	            <li>
	            	Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the
	               Sample RTE is installed (Default: C:\ADL\SCORM_2004_3rd_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.0).
	            </li>
	            <li>
	            	From this point, navigate to the Sample_RTE\source directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	            	At the prompt type "ant".
	            </li>
	         </ul>
	         
	         <p>
		         The XML Ant build files will compile all Java class and jar files
		         needed by the Sample RTE.  In addition the files will be 
		         installed to jakarta-tomcat-5.0.16.  
		         (NOTE: For changes to take effect, the tomcat server will need 
		         to be restarted).  This completes the compilation of the Sample 
		         RTE.

	         	<em>Source File Locations</em>
	         	<ul>
	            	<li>
	            		All JSP, HTML, and JavaScript files are located at
	                	&lt;Sample RTE Install Dir&gt;\Sample_RTE\source\SampleRTE\LMSClient
	             	</li>
	             	<li>
	             		The Sample RTE Java files are located in their respective
	                	package locations.  For example the data model classes are 
	                	located at "org\adl\datamodels".  The root of the Java 
	                	source directory is 
	                	&lt;Sample RTE Install Dir&gt;\Sample_RTE\source\src.
	                 	Here you will find the build script and the root "org"
	                 	directory.
	             	</li>
