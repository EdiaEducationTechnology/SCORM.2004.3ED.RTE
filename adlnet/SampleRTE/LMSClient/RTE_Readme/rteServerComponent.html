	            The Sample Run-Time Environment (RTE) Version 1.0 is composed of several 
	            distinct and separate components.  These components are as follows:
	         </p>
	         <p>
		         <ol style="margin-bottom: 0;">
		            <li>
		               Sample Run-Time Environment Server Component: Implemented using 
		               Java Applications and Java Servlets.
		            </li>
		            <li>
		               Run-Time Environment Client Component: Implemented using JSP,
		                Java Applets, HTML, and JavaScript.

	         	<strong>Sample Run-Time Environment Server Component</strong>
	         </p>
	         <p>
		         The Run-Time Environment Server Component is implemented using 
		         Java Servlets and Java Applications. The Servlets respond to 
		         requests from the Run-time Environment Client Component and are 
		         responsible for Data Model persistence as well as sequencing and 
		         parsing logic.  The modules that make up the Server Component 
		         are listed below:
	         </p>
	         <ul>
	            <li>
	               <i>ADL Validator</i>: This module is responsible for validating
	               the imsmanifest.xml file that is required in SCORM Content
	               Aggregation Content Packages.  The ADL 
                   Validator is also responsible for parsing the XML file and 
                   returning a DOM tree representation to the Sample RTE Server 
                   Component. <i>See the JavaDoc Package, "org.adl.validators" 
                   for details.</i>
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Utilities</i>: This module contains general purpose 
                   utility Java files.
	               <i>See the JavaDoc Package, "org.adl.util" for details.</i>
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>ADL Sequencer</i>: This module is responsible for handling
	               sequencing based on the IMS Simple Sequencing Specification and
	               SCORM 2004 3rd Edition Sequencing and Navigation Version 1.0.
	               It contains classes that create an initialized activity tree, 
	               maintain the activity tree throughout the sequencing process and 
	               handle all sequencing logic.
	               <i>See the JavaDoc Package, "org.adl.sequencer" for details.</i>
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Sample RTE</i>:  The Sample RTE Package is the hub of all of
	               the Server Component packages.  It contains the logic to utilize
	               the other packages when needed.  It also contains Java 
                   classes that interact with Java Server Pages to implement
                   server side functionality.
	               <i>See the JavaDoc Packages,"org.adl.samplerte.server" and
	               "org.adl.samplerte.util" for details.</i>
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Data Models</i>:  This package contains the classes that
	               maintain the SCORM Run-Time Environment Data Model and the 
                   Navigation Data Model. <i>See the JavaDoc Package 
                   "org.adl.datamodels" for details.</i>
	            </li>
                <li>
	               <i>Shareable State Persistence</i>:  This package contains 
                   the classes used to provide the IMS Shareable State 
                   Persistence implementation. <i>See the JavaDoc Package 
                   "org.ims.ssp.samplerte.server" for details.</i>
	            </li>
	         </ul>
