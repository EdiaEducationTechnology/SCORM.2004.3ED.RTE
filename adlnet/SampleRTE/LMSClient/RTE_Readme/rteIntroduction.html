            Welcome to the SCORM 2004 3rd Edition Sample Run-Time Environment (RTE) Version 1.0 
            (Referred to hereafter as Sample RTE).  The Sample RTE is intended 
            to provide an example implementation of the concepts described in 
            the SCORM. Specifically, it was developed in order to provide an 
            example of the SCORM Run-Time Environment(API and Data Model) and 
            SCORM Sequencing and Navigation as they might be applied in a 
            Learning Management System (LMS) environment.  Robust exception and 
            error handling has not been included in this sample code.
            </p>
   
            <p>
            Even though there are a number of valid Web-enabled SCORM
            implementations, this version of the Sample RTE was implemented as a
            Web-based client/server application using HTML, JavaScript,
            JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Applets and Java Servlets (See
            the &quot;Design Information&quot; section of this Readme for 
            additional Sample RTE design information).
