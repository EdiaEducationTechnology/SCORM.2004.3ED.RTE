            <li><!--- Ticket  8664--->
                 The Sample RTE now contains functionality to display
                 API calls made by SCOs launched by the Sample RTE.  To view 
                 the API calls that have been made by the SCOs, first click on 
                 the <i>Activate Log</i> link in the lower left corner of the
                 Sample RTE and then click on the <i>Show Log</i> link.  The log 
                 will be displayed in the frame immediately above the link.  
                 <i>Hide Log</i> will remove the display of the log string, but 
                 does not delete the log.  <i>Clear Log</i> deletes the current 
                 contents of the log.                           
            </li>
            <li><!--- Ticket 8711--->
                The Sample RTE has been updated to hide the <i>Suspend</i> button 
                when the Content Aggregation Content Package manifest explicitly 
                states that the <i>Suspend All</i> control should be hidden.
            </li>
            <li><!--- Ticket 8750--->
                The Sample RTE has been updated to allow invisible activities 
                to be the target of a <i>Choice</i> navigation event when no 
                Table of Contents is rendered.
            </li>
            <li><!--- Ticket 8779--->
                The Sample RTE has been updated to display a validation error 
                when importing a package in which there is a leaf item that 
                contains no identifierref attribute or if the identifierref 
                attribute is set to an empty string. In this case, the package 
                may be imported with validation turned off.  However, when 
                running the course contained in that package, if the element 
                with no identifierref attribute is reached, the 
                <i>ERROR</i> page will be displayed.
            </li>
            <li><!--- Ticket 8813--->
                The Sample RTE has been updated to process an <i>Exit All</i> 
                navigation request if the SCO sets cmi.exit to <i>time-out</i>.
                Any other pending navigation requests will be ignored.
            </li>
            <li><!--- Ticket 8840--->
               The Sample RTE Global Objectives Administration Page has been 
                updated to include error checking for the <i>measure</i> 
                value of a global objective. The acceptable 
                range for <i>measure</i> is -1.0 to 1.0.
            </li>
            <li><!-- Ticket 8976-->
                The Sample RTE has been updated to recognize and ignore empty 
                sequencing elements.  If these elements occur in a SCORM Content 
                Aggregation Content Package, the elements' defined defaults are 
                used.
           	<li> <!-- Ticket 8615-->
            	The Sample RTE has been updated so that if a <i>Suspend All</i>
                navigation event is invoked and cmi.exit is not set to 
                <i>suspend</i>, then SCORM Run-Time Environment 
                Data Model infomation will set cmi.exit to 
                <i>suspend</i> and persist the run-time data. 
            </li>
            <li> <!-- Ticket 8915-->
            	The Sample RTE has been updated to properly implement the 
                sequencing Selection Control element <i>Selection Count</i>.  
                The Selection Control elements enable content developers 
                to define sequencing information that indicates when to select 
                certain activities and to limit the number of activities to be 
                chosen.  The <i>Selection Count</i> element limits the number of 
                activities that are available.
            </li>
			<li> <!-- SSP-->
				The Sample RTE has been updated to include an example implementation 
				of IMS Shareable State Persistence SCORM Application Profile.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Ticket 10141-->
				The Sample RTE has been updated to properly handle several sets of
				non-English characters which may be used in the imsmanifest.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Ticket 9973-->
			    The Sample RTE has been updated to allow Data Model setValue values to
			    contain quotation marks and/or backslashes.  Values containg any number
			    of quotation marks and/or backslahses in any location in the value can 
			    be correctly displayed in the Data Model log.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Ticket 9969-->
			    The Sample RTE SampleRTE.mdb database has been updated to allow the
			    CourseTitle field of the CourseInfo table to store title strings
			    of up to 200 characters in length as specified in the SCORM_CAM
			    document.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Ticket 9942-->
			    The Sample RTE has been updated to allow item identifiers to be 
			    distingusished by string letter-case as well as string text.  
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Ticket 9909-->
			    The Sample RTE Data Model has been updated to allow time intervals 
			    containing sub-seconds to be correctly added and formatted between 
			    learner sessions.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Ticket 9809-->
			    The Sample RTE has been modified to include links to <i>Start Course</i>
			    and/or <i>View Table of Contents</i> for each course listed in the <i>View
			    Registered Courses</i> menu.  The links will allow the user to choose
			    to begin the course and start sequencing by choosing <i>Start Course</i>
			    if available, or view the Table of Contents and begin without starting 
			    sequencing by choosing <i>View Table of Contents</i> if available.
			</li>
			<li> <!--  -->
			    The Sample RTE has been updated to utilize a proprietary file upload tool
			    which has replaced the JSPSmartUpload tool.

               <!--  PT # 9162  -->
               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to display a validation error 
               when importing a package in which the IMS Manifest contains 
               an adlcp:persistState attribute.  The adlcp:persistState 
               attribute has been deleted.                
            </li>
            <li>
               <!--TWG Issue #19:  Sub-Manifest Merging Process-->
               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to no longer validate 
               (sub)manifest elements with the inclusion of metadata 
               within the (sub)manifest.  A warning is now issued when a 
               (sub)manifest is detected. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <!--  PT # 9316 -->
               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to display a validation error 
               when importing a package in which the IMS Manifest contains 
               a referencedObjective attribute of a 
               &lt;ruleCondition&gt; element that does not represent an 
               identifier of an objective (&lt;primaryObjective&gt; / 
               &lt;objective&gt;) found within that manifest.
            </li>
            <li>
               <!--  PT # 9312 && 9721-->
               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to 
               enforce that when a &lt;resource&gt; is local to the 
               content package, then a &lt;file&gt; element is required 
               that represents the &lt;resource&gt;.  The href attribute 
               of the &lt;file&gt; element must be identical to the 
               href attribute of the &lt;resource&gt;.  The &lt;file&gt; 
               element can exist as a direct child of the &lt;resource&gt; 
               or can be referenced from the &lt;dependency&gt; element.
            </li>
            <li>
               <!--  PT # 9310 -->
               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to 
               enforce that 0 or 1 &lt;adlcp:completionThreshold&gt; element 
               exist as a child of an &lt;item&gt; element.  The Sample RTE
               will display a validation error when more than 
               one &lt;adlcp:completionThreshold&gt; element is detected as 
               a child of the &lt;item&gt; element. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <!--  IMS CP 1.1.4 Change -->
               Based on the IMS CP 1.1.4 updates, the course import process of 
               the Sample RTE has been updated to enforce a Smallest Permitted 
               Maximum (SPM) value of 2000 characters for an href that is 
               pre-appended with xml:base value.  This is a Best Practice 
               warning only and does not affect validation. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <!--  IMS CP 1.1.4 Change -->
               Based on the IMS CP 1.1.4 updates, the course import process of 
               the Sample RTE has been updated to enforce excess baggage and 
               dangling resource checks.  Excess baggage is considered as files 
               that exist in the Content Package that are not referenced from 
               the IMS Manifest.  Dangling resources elements are those that 
               are not referenced by an "identifierref" attribute.  These checks 
               are Best Practice warnings only and do not affect validation.  
            </li>
            <li>
               <!--  IMS CP 1.1.4 Change -->
               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to  
               display an error when the parameters attribute of an 
               &lt;item&gt; element does not abide to the following syntax:
               <ul> 
                  <li>#&lt;parameter&gt;</li>   
                      <li>&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;(&&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;)*(#&lt;parameter&gt;)</li>   
                      <li>?&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;(&&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;)*(#&lt;parameter&gt;)</li>

            </li>
            <li>
               <!--  Substring issue -->
               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to prevent
               a java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException from occurring when 
               a URI of 4 characters or less in length exists in an IMS 
               Manifest.              
            </li>
            <li>
               <!-- schemaversion element update -->
               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to 
               conform to the requirement of SCORM 2004 3rd Edition that the 
               <schemaversion> element value equal "2004 3rd Edition". If the 
               SCORM 2004 2nd Edition vocabulary token of "CAM 1.3" is detected, 
               the course import process has been updated to display a warning 
               with the ADL recommendation to update the value to "2004 3rd 
               Edition". It is recommended that the content package manifest be 
               updated because some systems may rely on this value to process 
               the content package.
            </li>
            <li>
               <!-- 9853 -->
               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to 
               produce a validation warning when the xsi:schemalocation 
               attribute in the root manifest declaration is not declared. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <!-- 9853 -->
               When no xsi:schemalocation attribute is declared in the root 
               manifest declaration, the Sample RTE provides the XML Parser with 
               a defaulted list of controlling documents to use for XML 
               validation.  The course import process of the Sample RTE has been 
               updated to test for only those controlling document(s) to exist 
               at the root of the content package only if the respective 
               namespace has been declared. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <!-- 10298 -->
               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to 
               produce a warning when a URI exists multiple times in the IMS 
               Manifest differing only in case.  
            </li>
            <li>
               <!-- 10016 -->
               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to 
               support content package zip files that contain non-ASCII 
               characters in the file name.      
            </li>
            <li>
               The Sequencer was updated to ensure that objective state (local 
               and global) is not affected by measure threshold evaluations 
               during tree traversals.
            </li>
            <li>
               Numerous changes were made to the Sample RTE client to align 
               implementation with the updated user interface interoperability 
               requirements defined in the SCORM 2004 3rd Edition Conformance 
               Requirements Document.
