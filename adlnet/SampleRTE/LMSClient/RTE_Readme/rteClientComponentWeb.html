	         		Sample Run-Time Environment Client Component (Web Files)
	         	</strong>
	         	is comprised of the following modules:
	         </p>
	         <ul>
	            <li>
	               <i>Administrative</i>: This module contains files that change
	               passwords, delete courses, manage global objectives, create or
	               delete users, delete courses and clear the Sample RTE database.
	               The files that make up the Administrative module are located 
                   in the "admin" folder.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Help</i>: This module contains information pages on how to
	               use the Sample RTE.  The files that make up the Help module 
                   are located in the "help" folder.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Import</i>: This module is responsible for managing the course
	               import process.  These files utilize the Sample Run-Time
                    Environment Server side Java Component to handle parsing, 
                    validation and database access. The files that make up the 
                    Import module are located in the "import" folder.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Includes</i>:  The Sample RTE utilizes a style sheet (*.css)
	               that handles the interface look and feel.  See
	               sampleRTE_style.css for details.  This file is located in the
	               "includes" directory under the Sample RTE Web Root.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Run-Time</i>:  This module contains the files used to deliver
	               a SCORM Conformant Content Aggregation Content Package.  
                   In addition, the SCORM Application Programming Interface is 
                   included.  All images used in the Sample RTE menu are 
                   located in the "menu-images" directory located in this 
                   module.  The files that make up the Run-Time module are 
                   located in the "runtime" directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Special State</i>: This module contains information pages that
	               describe special sequencing states.  It is possible that content
	               will not be delivered as result of a sequencing request.  In that
	               event these pages inform the user about what state the sequencer
	               is in.  NOTE:  These pages are included to help debug sequencing
	               in content.  There is no requirement by the SCORM that they be
	               presented.  LMSs may handle sequencing states in their
	               own manner.  The files that make up the Special State 
	               module are located in the "specialstate" folder under the 
                   Sample RTE Web Root.
	            </li>
