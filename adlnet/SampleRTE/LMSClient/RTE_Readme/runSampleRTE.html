		         The instructions provided are for running the Sample RTE on a 
		         Windows platform.  This is the only platform that the software 
		         has been tested on and is the only platform for which 
		         instructions are provided at this time.
	         </p>
	         <p>
	         	<strong>To Run the Sample RTE:</strong>
	         </p>
	         <p>
		         First, start the jakarta-tomcat-5.0.16 servlet container and
		         web server that is provided with this installation.  To do this:
	         	<ul>
		            <li>
			            Click on the shortcut at Start Menu -> All Programs -> ADL -> 
			            SCORM_2004_3rd_Edition_Sample_Run-Time_Environment_version_1.0 -> Start Server.  You will see a command 
			            prompt window appear and show several lines of textual 
			            information.  This window will remain open until you stop 
			            the server.
		            </li>
		            <li>
			            Next click on the Start Menu -> All Programs -> ADL -> 
                        SCORM_2004_3rd_Edition_Sample_Run-Time_Environment_version_1.0 -> SCORM 2004 3rd Edition Sample Run-Time Environment version 1.0. This will launch 
                        the Sample RTE Main page.  Log in with the username: 
                        "admin", password: "admin".  
                        (Be sure that Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 
			            is your default browser.)
		            </li>
	        		</ul>
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	           	Online help pages are available once the Sample RTE is started.
	           	"Help" links appear at the bottom of each page.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	          	To close the Sample RTE, first close the browser in which it is 
                running.  To stop the jakarta-tomcat-5.0.16 servlet container 
                and web server, click on the 
                Start Menu -> All Programs -> ADL -> SCORM_2004_3rd_Edition_Sample_Run-Time_Environment_version_1.0 -> Stop Server.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	           	To return the Sample RTE to a "clean" state, log into the Sample 
	           	RTE and from the main menu choose the Clear Database option.  
	           	This will remove all course files that have been imported as 
	           	well as any information associated with them, including IMS SSP
                buckets and related information; and will remove all user 
                registration information. All Global Objective information will 
                also be removed.
