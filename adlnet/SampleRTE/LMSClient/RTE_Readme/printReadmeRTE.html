            Welcome to the SCORM 2004 3rd Edition Sample Run-Time Environment (RTE) Version 1.0 
            (Referred to hereafter as Sample RTE).  The Sample RTE is intended 
            to provide an example implementation of the concepts described in 
            the SCORM. Specifically, it was developed in order to provide an 
            example of the SCORM Run-Time Environment(API and Data Model) and 
            SCORM Sequencing and Navigation as they might be applied in a 
            Learning Management System (LMS) environment.  Robust exception and 
            error handling has not been included in this sample code.
            </p>
   
            <p>
            Even though there are a number of valid Web-enabled SCORM
            implementations, this version of the Sample RTE was implemented as a
            Web-based client/server application using HTML, JavaScript,
            JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Applets and Java Servlets (See
            the &quot;Design Information&quot; section of this Readme for 
            additional Sample RTE design information).

                        The Sample RTE requires the full J2SE SDK.  The J2SE 
                        JRE alone is NOT sufficient for this software.

                        other than the one on which it is installed using 
                        Microsoft Internet Explorer.  In this case, the J2SE 
                        Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed on the 
                        second machine.

                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
	         </p>
	         <p>
	            After installing the J2SE SDK, you must do the following:
	            <ol style="margin-bottom: 0;">
	               <li>
	                  Create an environment variable named "JAVA_HOME" and set 
	                  its value to the root directory of the J2SE SDK.
	                  <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
	                     <li>
	                        For Windows 2000 and XP: Right click on "My Computer",
	                        select "Properties", select the "Advanced" tab and then
	                        click on "Environment Variables". Add a JAVA_HOME entry
	                        in the User or System Variables that points to the
	                        location where the J2SE SDK was installed
	                        (i.e., C:\j2sdk1.4.2_05).

	               <li>
	                  Add the full path of the J2SE SDK bin directory (where the
	                  java.exe is located) to the PATH environment variable.
	                  <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
	                     <li>
	                        For Windows 2000 and XP: Right click on "My Computer",

	                        click on "Environment Variables". Add the J2SE SDK bin

	                        a reference to the JAVA_HOME environment variable
	                        followed by "\bin" (i.e., %JAVA_HOME%\bin).

	            The Sample RTE is available for download as a self-extracting
	            executable install file. Once you have completed 
	            downloading the file, perform the following steps:
	            <ol>
	               <li>
	                  Double-click on the downloaded self-extracting executable 
	                  file to begin the installation process.
	               </li>
	               <li>
	                  Click the &quot;Next&quot; button to continue 
	                  from the &quot;Welcome&quot; page.
	               </li>
	               <li>
	                  Read the &quot;License Agreement&quot; and
	                  <ul>
	                     <li>
	                        Click the &quot;Yes&quot; button to agree 
	                        and continue with the install.
	                     </li>
	                     <li>
	                        Click the &quot;No&quot; button if you do 
	                        not agree with the terms of the license and wish to 
	                        exit the install.
	                     </li>
	                  </ul>
	               </li>
	               <li>
	                  The recommended root installation directory
	                  is &quot;C:\ADL&quot;. You may choose
	                  another root installation directory, but the Sample RTE
	                  install will always append the 
	                  &quot;\ADL\SCORM_2004_3rd_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.0&quot; sub-directory to the
	                  specified root installation directory.  The remainder 
	                  of this Readme document assumes that the Sample RTE will be
	                  installed to &quot;C:\ADL\C:\ADL\SCORM_2004_3rd_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.0&quot;.  
	                  This is referred to as 
	                  &quot;&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;install_directory&gt;&quot;. If 
	                  you override the default to use a different root 
	                  installation directory, please take that into consideration 
	                  when reading the remainder of this Readme.
	               </li>
	               <li>Click the &quot;Next&quot; button</li>
	               <li>
	                  The install will add program icons to the Program Folder of
	                  your Start menu. You may type a new folder name, or
	                  select one from the existing list of Start Menu folders.  
	                  It is recommended that you use &quot;ADL&quot;.  Then 
	                  click on the &quot;Next&quot; button to install 
	                  the Sample RTE.  The installation program will copy the 
	                  necessary files to the appropriate directories at this time.
	               </li>

	         After installation, the following actions are necessary to ensure 
             that the Sample RTE will run properly:
	         <ul>
	           	<li>
	              	The Microsoft Internet Explorer browser must be set to check
	              	for a new page every visit to the page.  To configure the
	              	browser:
	              	<ul>
	                 	<li>Open a Microsoft Internet Explorer browser.</li>
	                 	<li>Click on "Tools" -> "Internet Options".</li>
	                 	<li>
	                 		On the "General" tab, "Temporary Internet files"
	                  	sub-section, click "Settings".
	                 	</li>
	                 	<li>
	                 		Ensure that the "Every visit to the page" radio button
	                  	is selected.
	                 	</li>
	                 	<li>
	                  	Click "OK" and then "OK" again.
	                 	</li>
	              	</ul>
	            </li>
                <br>
	            <li>
	               The Java Plug-in must be configured to disable caching.  To
	               disable the Java Plug-in cache:
	               <ul>

					     Environment Applet(s).</li>
				      </ul>
				      </li>
			       </ul>
            	</li>
                <br>
	            <li>
	               Ensure that the Sun Java Plug-in is selected as the default
	               Java Environment for the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser.
	               To set the default browser Java Environment:

	                     using to run the Sample RTE</li>
	                  <li>Click "Apply"</li>
               	   </ul>
	            </li>
                <br>
	            <li>
	               If you are using Windows XP SP2 these additional actions are
	               required:
	               <ul>
	                  <li>
	                     Allow JavaScript to run by:
	                     <ul>
	                        <li>Open a Microsoft Internet Explorer browser</li>
	                        <li>Click on "Tools" -> "Internet Options"</li>
	                        <li>
	                           On the "Advanced" tab, check the box that states,
	                           "Allow active content to run in files on My
	                           Computer" under the "Security" section.
	                        </li>
	                     </ul>
	                  </li>
	                  <li>
	                     Allow the Sample RTE to pop-up windows by either
	                     disabling pop-up blocking or exclude the Sample RTE
	                     from pop-up blocking.
	                  </li>
	               </ul>
	            </li>
	         </ul>

	                  if Applet Caching is enabled.  If this occurs,
	                  the following steps can be taken to correct the issue in 
                    Java Versions 1.4 and later (up to but not including 
                    Version 5.0):
	                  <ul>
	                     <li>
	                  	    Enter Control Panel in your Windows environment.

	                     <li>
	                     	Click Yes when prompted to confirm.

                 The Sample RTE now contains functionality to display
                 API calls made by SCOs launched by the Sample RTE.  To view 
                 the API calls that have been made by the SCOs, first click on 
                 the <i>Activate Log</i> link in the lower left corner of the
                 Sample RTE and then click on the <i>Show Log</i> link.  The log 
                 will be displayed in the frame immediately above the link.  
                 <i>Hide Log</i> will remove the display of the log string, but 
                 does not delete the log.  <i>Clear Log</i> deletes the current 
                 contents of the log.                           
            </li>
            <li><!--- Ticket 8711--->
                The Sample RTE has been updated to hide the <i>Suspend</i> button 
                when the Content Aggregation Content Package manifest explicitly 
                states that the <i>Suspend All</i> control should be hidden.
            </li>
            <li><!--- Ticket 8750--->
                The Sample RTE has been updated to allow invisible activities 
                to be the target of a <i>Choice</i> navigation event when no 
                Table of Contents is rendered.
            </li>
            <li><!--- Ticket 8779--->
                The Sample RTE has been updated to display a validation error 
                when importing a package in which there is a leaf item that 
                contains no identifierref attribute or if the identifierref 
                attribute is set to an empty string. In this case, the package 
                may be imported with validation turned off.  However, when 
                running the course contained in that package, if the element 
                with no identifierref attribute is reached, the 
                <i>ERROR</i> page will be displayed.
            </li>
            <li><!--- Ticket 8813--->
                The Sample RTE has been updated to process an <i>Exit All</i> 
                navigation request if the SCO sets cmi.exit to <i>time-out</i>.
                Any other pending navigation requests will be ignored.
            </li>
            <li><!--- Ticket 8840--->
               The Sample RTE Global Objectives Administration Page has been 
                updated to include error checking for the <i>measure</i> 
                value of a global objective. The acceptable 
                range for <i>measure</i> is -1.0 to 1.0.
            </li>
            <li><!-- Ticket 8976-->
                The Sample RTE has been updated to recognize and ignore empty 
                sequencing elements.  If these elements occur in a SCORM Content 
                Aggregation Content Package, the elements' defined defaults are 
                used.
           	<li> <!-- Ticket 8615-->
            	The Sample RTE has been updated so that if a <i>Suspend All</i>
                navigation event is invoked and cmi.exit is not set to 
                <i>suspend</i>, then SCORM Run-Time Environment 
                Data Model infomation will set cmi.exit to 
                <i>suspend</i> and persist the run-time data. 
            </li>
            <li> <!-- Ticket 8915-->
            	The Sample RTE has been updated to properly implement the 
                sequencing Selection Control element <i>Selection Count</i>.  
                The Selection Control elements enable content developers 
                to define sequencing information that indicates when to select 
                certain activities and to limit the number of activities to be 
                chosen.  The <i>Selection Count</i> element limits the number of 
                activities that are available.
            </li>
			<li> <!-- SSP-->
				The Sample RTE has been updated to include an example implementation 
				of IMS Shareable State Persistence SCORM Application Profile.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Ticket 10141-->
				The Sample RTE has been updated to properly handle several sets of
				non-English characters which may be used in the imsmanifest.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- Ticket 9973-->

		            <li>
			            Click on the shortcut at Start Menu -> All Programs -> ADL -> 
			            SCORM_2004_3rd_Edition_Sample_Run-Time_Environment_version_1.0 -> Start Server.  You will see a command 
			            prompt window appear and show several lines of textual 
			            information.  This window will remain open until you stop 
			            the server.
		            </li>
		            <li>
			            Next click on the Start Menu -> All Programs -> ADL -> 
                        SCORM_2004_3rd_Edition_Sample_Run-Time_Environment_version_1.0 -> SCORM 2004 3rd Edition Sample Run-Time Environment version 1.0. This will launch 
                        the Sample RTE Main page.  Log in with the username: 
                        "admin", password: "admin".  
                        (Be sure that Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 
			            is your default browser.)

	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	           	Online help pages are available once the Sample RTE is started.
	           	"Help" links appear at the bottom of each page.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	          	To close the Sample RTE, first close the browser in which it is

	        	<p>
	           	To return the Sample RTE to a "clean" state, log into the Sample 
	           	RTE and from the main menu choose the Clear Database option.  
	           	This will remove all course files that have been imported as 
	           	well as any information associated with them, including IMS SSP
                buckets and related information; and will remove all user

	               <i>Sample RTE</i>:  The Sample RTE Package is the hub of all of
	               the Server Component packages.  It contains the logic to utilize
	               the other packages when needed.  It also contains Java 
                   classes that interact with Java Server Pages to implement
                   server side functionality.
	               <i>See the JavaDoc Packages,"org.adl.samplerte.server" and

	         		Sample Run-Time Environment Client Component (Web Files)
	         	</strong>
	         	is comprised of the following modules:
	         </p>
	         <ul>
	            <li>
	               <i>Administrative</i>: This module contains files that change
	               passwords, delete courses, manage global objectives, create or
	               delete users, delete courses and clear the Sample RTE database.
	               The files that make up the Administrative module are located 
                   in the "admin" folder.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Help</i>: This module contains information pages on how to
	               use the Sample RTE.  The files that make up the Help module 
                   are located in the "help" folder.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Import</i>: This module is responsible for managing the course
	               import process.  These files utilize the Sample Run-Time
                    Environment Server side Java Component to handle parsing, 
                    validation and database access. The files that make up the 
                    Import module are located in the "import" folder.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Includes</i>:  The Sample RTE utilizes a style sheet (*.css)
	               that handles the interface look and feel.  See
	               sampleRTE_style.css for details.  This file is located in the
	               "includes" directory under the Sample RTE Web Root.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Run-Time</i>:  This module contains the files used to deliver
	               a SCORM Conformant Content Aggregation Content Package.  
                   In addition, the SCORM Application Programming Interface is 
                   included.  All images used in the Sample RTE menu are 
                   located in the "menu-images" directory located in this 
                   module.  The files that make up the Run-Time module are 
                   located in the "runtime" directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Special State</i>: This module contains information pages that
	               describe special sequencing states.  It is possible that content
	               will not be delivered as result of a sequencing request.  In that
	               event these pages inform the user about what state the sequencer
	               is in.  NOTE:  These pages are included to help debug sequencing
	               in content.  There is no requirement by the SCORM that they be
	               presented.  LMSs may handle sequencing states in their
	               own manner.  The files that make up the Special State 
	               module are located in the "specialstate" folder under the 
                   Sample RTE Web Root.

                    source code has been changed.

	         </p>
	         <p>
		         <em>In order to compile the Sample RTE, the full installation
		         instructions must be completed first.</em>  The Sample RTE 
		         build file depends on a full jakarta-tomcat-5.0.16 install, 
		         along with resources provided in the installation of the RTE.  
                 It is important to note that when the RTE is built, it 
                 overwrites the previously installed Sample RTE. To move back 
                 to the original RTE, the un-install must be executed and then 
                 the downloaded self-extracting executable must be re-run.
	         </p>
	         <p>
		         The Sample RTE is built using Apache Ant, a Java-based build tool.
		         <b>Before building the Sample RTE, Ant must be installed.</b>
		         For information about and downloads of Ant, see
	         	<a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">http://ant.apache.org/</a>.
	         </p>
	
	         <em>
	         	To build the Sample RTE:
	         </em>
	         <ul>
	            <li>
	            	Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the
	               Sample RTE is installed (Default: C:\ADL\SCORM_2004_3rd_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.0).
	            </li>
	            <li>
	            	From this point, navigate to the Sample_RTE\source directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	            	At the prompt type "ant".
	            </li>
	         </ul>
	         
	         <p>
		         The XML Ant build files will compile all Java class and jar files
		         needed by the Sample RTE.  In addition the files will be 
		         installed to jakarta-tomcat-5.0.16.  
		         (NOTE: For changes to take effect, the tomcat server will need 
		         to be restarted).  This completes the compilation of the Sample 
		         RTE.

	         	<ul>

	             	</li>
	             	<li>
	             		The Sample RTE Java files are located in their respective
	                	package locations.  For example the data model classes are 
	                	located at "org\adl\datamodels".  The root of the Java
