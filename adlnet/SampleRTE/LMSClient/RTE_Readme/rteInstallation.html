                        The Sample RTE requires the full J2SE SDK.  The J2SE 
                        JRE alone is NOT sufficient for this software.

                        The Sample RTE client may be accessed from a machine 
                        other than the one on which it is installed using 
                        Microsoft Internet Explorer.  In this case, the J2SE 
                        Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed on the 
                        second machine.

               </ul>
	         </p>
	         <p>
	            After installing the J2SE SDK, you must do the following:
	            <ol style="margin-bottom: 0;">
	               <li>
	                  Create an environment variable named "JAVA_HOME" and set 
	                  its value to the root directory of the J2SE SDK.
	                  <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
	                     <li>
	                        For Windows 2000 and XP: Right click on "My Computer",
	                        select "Properties", select the "Advanced" tab and then
	                        click on "Environment Variables". Add a JAVA_HOME entry
	                        in the User or System Variables that points to the
	                        location where the J2SE SDK was installed
	                        (i.e., C:\j2sdk1.4.2_05).

	               </li>
	               <li>
	                  Add the full path of the J2SE SDK bin directory (where the
	                  java.exe is located) to the PATH environment variable.
	                  <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">

	                        For Windows 2000 and XP: Right click on "My Computer",
	                        select "Properties", select the "Advanced" tab and then
	                        click on "Environment Variables". Add the J2SE SDK bin
	                        directory to the Path by adding a semicolon followed by
	                        a reference to the JAVA_HOME environment variable
	                        followed by "\bin" (i.e., %JAVA_HOME%\bin).

	            The Sample RTE is available for download as a self-extracting
	            executable install file. Once you have completed 
	            downloading the file, perform the following steps:
	            <ol>
	               <li>
	                  Double-click on the downloaded self-extracting executable 
	                  file to begin the installation process.
	               </li>
	               <li>
	                  Click the &quot;Next&quot; button to continue 
	                  from the &quot;Welcome&quot; page.
	               </li>
	               <li>
	                  Read the &quot;License Agreement&quot; and
	                  <ul>
	                     <li>
	                        Click the &quot;Yes&quot; button to agree 
	                        and continue with the install.
	                     </li>
	                     <li>
	                        Click the &quot;No&quot; button if you do 
	                        not agree with the terms of the license and wish to 
	                        exit the install.
	                     </li>
	                  </ul>
	               </li>
	               <li>
	                  The recommended root installation directory
	                  is &quot;C:\ADL&quot;. You may choose
	                  another root installation directory, but the Sample RTE
	                  install will always append the 
	                  &quot;\ADL\SCORM_2004_3rd_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.0&quot; sub-directory to the
	                  specified root installation directory.  The remainder 
	                  of this Readme document assumes that the Sample RTE will be
	                  installed to &quot;C:\ADL\C:\ADL\SCORM_2004_3rd_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.0&quot;.  
	                  This is referred to as 
	                  &quot;&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;install_directory&gt;&quot;. If 
	                  you override the default to use a different root 
	                  installation directory, please take that into consideration 
	                  when reading the remainder of this Readme.
	               </li>
	               <li>Click the &quot;Next&quot; button</li>
	               <li>
	                  The install will add program icons to the Program Folder of
	                  your Start menu. You may type a new folder name, or
	                  select one from the existing list of Start Menu folders.  
	                  It is recommended that you use &quot;ADL&quot;.  Then 
	                  click on the &quot;Next&quot; button to install 
	                  the Sample RTE.  The installation program will copy the 
	                  necessary files to the appropriate directories at this time.
	               </li>
	               <li>

	                     </ul>
	                  </li>
	                  <li>
	                     Allow the Sample RTE to pop-up windows by either
	                     disabling pop-up blocking or exclude the Sample RTE
	                     from pop-up blocking.
	                  </li>
