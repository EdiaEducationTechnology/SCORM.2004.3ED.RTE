To build using maven 1 (for sakai 2-4-x), you'll need to include the following steps:

(1) Check out entitybroker from https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/entitybroker/tags/1.2 and build it

(2) Check out sakai-wicket from https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/wicket/sakai-wicket/trunk/ -- it now includes a project.xml
as of Jun 10, 2008.
