This is still a relatively early prototype of the SCORM Player, but it's starting to look relatively similar to the final product. Note
that it only works currently for admin, or a user you give all the scorm.* functions to within a given realm. I'm going to fix that very 
soon so it will work for a user with scorm.visible and scorm.launch, minimally. 

Pay no attention to the "Status" field yet, and the content package dates for Open, Due, and Accept Until are not yet being fully recognized.
That should be a relatively quick fix. 

The big chunk of work right now is to get the "Grade" screens to work. I've temporarily disabled the old code I'd written (which was fairly
skeletal anyway) in favor of using services that for the most part don't expose any ADL interfaces or classes. The goal here is to have 
a cleanly abstracted service layer, which has not been the case until this point... there are still some artifacts of the earlier way of
doing things around, including the use of a "facade" called ScormClientFacade, which was pretty much pointless. I'm going to be removing 
that in favor of the actual services themselves being dependency injected. 

The SjaxCall stuff has been significantly refactored and cleaned up, and there's probably still some work to be done there. 

Once the Newport Beach Conference is over, I'll most likely have a chance to fix most of these holes and some others I'm forgetting right
now. I'm hoping to have something solid by the end of December for the first stage of beta testing.
