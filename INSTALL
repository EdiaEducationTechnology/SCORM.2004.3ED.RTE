INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS

FIRST STEP: Checkout the Foundation 2.5.x branch of Sakai and build it. At UCDavis we've also
been successfully running it against our local 2.4.x branch, which is fairly close to the
2.4.x maintenance branch. 
(You'll need maven 2 installed and configured, and a tomcat dir
as per the normal Sakai directions for building)

(1) svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/sakai/branches/sakai_2-5-x/ sakai

(2) cd sakai/

(3) mvn clean install sakai:deploy


SECOND STEP: Install sakai-wicket

(1) In your sakai base directory (e.g. sakai/), svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/wicket/sakai-wicket/trunk/ sakai-wicket 

(2) Modify the pom.xml at the base directory (e.g. sakai/pom.xml) to include a module "sakai-wicket" (and "scorm", as directed below)

(3) cd sakai-wicket/

(4) It shouldn't be necessary to mess with the wicket version any longer (1.3.0 seems to work
for us just fine)

(5) mvn clean install sakai:deploy


THIRD STEP: Install the scorm component (api, impl, and tool) -- you may already have done this, if you're reading this file.

(1) In your sakai base directory (e.g. sakai/), svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/scorm/SCORM.2004.3ED.RTE/trunk/ scorm

(2) Modify the pom.xml at the base directory (e.g. sakai/pom.xml) to include a module "scorm"

(2.b) [optional] You may also modify the components.xml as per the in-line comments to use
		 the StandaloneResourceService in place of the SakaiResourceService -- doing
		 this will mean that the resources get unpacked and stored in a directory
		 called 'contentPackages' wherever you run startup.sh (by default) for the
		 tomcat instance (or under logs, depending on your tomcat config). This
		 will improve the performance of the player slightly, and leads to a 
		 less tightly integrated deployment with Sakai. Of course, since the 
		 other services (notably LearningManagementSystem) depend on Sakai, this 
	         is mostly an academic distinction for the moment. It's important to note
		 that this deployment will be incompatible with the default deployment -- 
		 each time you change you will no longer be able to access resources stored
		 in the other method. Also, if you do use StandaloneResourceService you
		 will want to think about whether that data will stick around when/if you
		 rebuild Sakai and/or redeploy Tomcat. 

(3) cd scorm/

(4) mvn clean install sakai:deploy


FOURTH STEP: Start up tomcat.
