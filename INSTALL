INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS

FIRST STEP: Checkout the Foundation 2.5.x branch of Sakai and build it. (You'll need maven 2 installed and configured, and a tomcat dir
as per the normal Sakai directions for building)

(1) svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/sakai/branches/sakai_2-5-x/ sakai

(2) cd sakai/

(3) mvn clean install sakai:deploy


SECOND STEP: Install sakai-wicket

(1) In your sakai base directory (e.g. sakai/), svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/wicket/sakai-wicket/trunk/ sakai-wicket 

(2) Modify the pom.xml at the base directory (e.g. sakai/pom.xml) to include a module "sakai-wicket" (and "scorm", as directed below)

(3) cd sakai-wicket/

(4) mvn clean install sakai:deploy


THIRD STEP: Install the scorm component (api, impl, and tool) -- you may already have done this, if you're reading this file.

(1) In your sakai base directory (e.g. sakai/), svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/scorm/SCORM.2004.3ED.RTE/trunk/ scorm

(2) Modify the pom.xml at the base directory (e.g. sakai/pom.xml) to include a module "scorm"

(3) cd scorm/

(4) mvn clean install sakai:deploy



OPTIONAL FOURTH STEP: Activate 'Content Hosting Handler Resolver' (If you want to use the chh build as opposed to unzipping content packages)

Note!!!! This is currently broken functionality (1/15/2008) -- and may no longer be necessary. 

It's important that you enable the Content Hosting Handler resolver in order to be able to correctly make use of the Scorm Player.

To do this, 

(1) Add the following properties to your sakai.properties (in your tomcat/sakai directory):

	content.useCHH=true

(2) Go to content/content-impl/pack/src/webapp/WEB-INF/components.xml and remove the comments from the 
    contentHostingHandlerResolver property in the bean org.sakaiproject.content.api.ContentHostingService:

	<!--
	<property name="contentHostingHandlerResolver"><ref bean="org.sakaiproject.content.api.ContentHostingHandlerResolver"/></property>
	-->
	^^ Remove both sets of comment tags (<!-- and -->)	


(3) Rebuild content.
	(a) cd content/
	(b) mvn clean install sakai:deploy


FOURTH (OR FIFTH) STEP: Start up tomcat.
