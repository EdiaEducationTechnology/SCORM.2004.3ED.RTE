INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS

*Updated August 18, 2008*

FIRST STEP: Checkout the appropriate Sakai branch or trunk. 

(You'll need maven 2 installed and configured, and a tomcat dir
as per the normal Sakai directions for building)

(1) svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/sakai/trunk sakai

(2) cd sakai/

(3) mvn clean install sakai:deploy


SECOND STEP: Install sakai-wicket (or bring it in from a maven repo)

Note: We're currently (as of Aug 18, 2008) working to get a version of sakai-wicket into the Sakai maven repo. Once it's there you 
won't need to build it at all. It should be just another maven dependency.

(1) In your sakai base directory (e.g. sakai/), svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/wicket/sakai-wicket/branches/1.0 sakai-wicket 

(2) Modify the pom.xml at the base directory (e.g. sakai/pom.xml) to include a module "sakai-wicket" (and "scorm", as directed below)

(3) cd sakai-wicket/

(4) It shouldn't be necessary to mess with the wicket version any longer (1.3.0 seems to work for us just fine)

(5) mvn clean install sakai:deploy


THIRD STEP: Install the scorm component (api, impl, and tool) -- you may already have done this, if you're reading this file.

(1) In your sakai base directory (e.g. sakai/), svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/scorm/SCORM.2004.3ED.RTE/trunk/ scorm

(2) Modify the pom.xml at the base directory (e.g. sakai/pom.xml) to include a module "scorm"

(2.b) [optional] You may also modify the components.xml as per the in-line comments to use
		 the StandaloneResourceService in place of the SakaiResourceService -- doing
		 this will mean that the resources get unpacked and stored in a directory
		 called 'contentPackages' wherever you run startup.sh (by default) for the
		 tomcat instance (or under logs, depending on your tomcat config). This
		 will improve the performance of the player slightly, and leads to a 
		 less tightly integrated deployment with Sakai. Of course, since the 
		 other services (notably LearningManagementSystem) depend on Sakai, this 
	         is mostly an academic distinction for the moment. It's important to note
		 that this deployment will be incompatible with the default deployment -- 
		 each time you change you will no longer be able to access resources stored
		 in the other method. Also, if you do use StandaloneResourceService you
		 will want to think about whether that data will stick around when/if you
		 rebuild Sakai and/or redeploy Tomcat. 

(3) cd scorm/

(4) mvn clean install sakai:deploy


FOURTH STEP: Start up tomcat.


CAVEAT: In order to use the SCORM Player in any site, you will need the Resources tool to be available as well. Otherwise you'll
get a runtime exception. We're planning to introduce a fix for this that will at least notify you that you need the Resources tool, 
but for now it can be quite confusing.
